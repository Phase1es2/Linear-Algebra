Unintended Consequences and Ethical Considerations \n","\n","Suppose that we are developing a prototype of a product for an do-it-yourself investment broker (think Fidelity, Charles Schwabb, Robin Hood, etc).

We (a team of software development engineers) are excited about this because we have a working prototype for the 2-stock scenario! All we need to do is take a class in multivariable calcus and use what we learn about optimizing functions in $n$ dimensions to update ```Sharpe_Ratio``` to find the optimal allocation for $n$ stocks. \n","\n","**Exercise 7**.

Investing 30% of their budget in stock A means that they trade money for stock A now (buy stock A), then in the future they trade their shares in stock A for money (sell stock A). If the return on stock A is positive they make money on those trades, if its negative they lose money. \n","\n","* Scenario 2: ```x_optimal```$ = -0.30 = -30\\%$ can be interpreted as \"the reverse of Scenario 1.\" How would this work? An investor trades an I-Owe-You for shares in stock A later for money now. They then take the money and invest it (plus the rest of their budget) into stock B (```y_optimal```$ = 1.30 = 130\\%$. Why would they do this? They have strong reason to believe that stock B is a better buy (will have a significantly better return) than stock A. So they \"leverage\" their position to go all in (and then some!) on stock B. This strategy is commonly called \"short-selling.\"\n","\n","**Question**.

If so, how much (as a percentage of the user's total portfolio)? What are the pros and cons of allowing it on our app? What can happen to ```S_max``` if you limit short-selling?
