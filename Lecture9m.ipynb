Least Squares Applications with Real Data Sets\n","\n","So far we have used least squares (regression) models to solve toy problems with small artificial data sets. In this lecture (and Lab 5) we will build models using real data sets. Using real data is messy. Most of these problems will involve extra steps getting the data preprocessed into a useable design matrix $X$. \n","\n","Recall that the once we have specified our model (linear, quadratic, exponential, etc) and built our design matrix we want to find a solution to \n","\n","\\begin{align} X\\beta = y. \\end{align}\n","\n","Unless $y$ is in the column space of $X$ we will not be able to solve this system exactly.
