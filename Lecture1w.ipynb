Vectors in Python: The Numpy Library\n","\n","Python is an object-oriented programming language and its API reflects this. Unless you're dealing with a simple base built-in object (ints, floats, strings, tuples, dicts, lists, bools, None, etc) you will probably need to use a library to build these objects. Since a \"vector\" isn't a built-in object we'll use the numpy library to construct vectors.
