We (a team of software development engineers) are excited about this because we have a working prototype for the 2-stock scenario!

Investing 30% of their budget in stock A means that they trade money for stock A now (buy stock A), then in the future they trade their shares in stock A for money (sell stock A).

An investor trades an I-Owe-You for shares in stock A later for money now. They then take the money and invest it (plus the rest of their budget) into stock B (```y_optimal```$ = 1.30 = 130\\%$). Why would they do this? They have strong reason to believe that stock B is a better buy (will have a significantly better return) than stock A.
